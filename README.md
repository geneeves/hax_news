This app is a hacker news clone, built during [Epicodus Fall 2013](http://www.epicodus.com) by [Geneva Skeen](http://geneevesco.site44.com).

To work the app locally, make sure to run `rake db:create` and `rake db:schema:load` to set up the database. Start up your rails server with `rails s` and then you're ready to go.
